# Heart Failure Prediction With Deep Learning
#### Introduction 
This [Jupyter Notebook](Heart_Failure_Prediction_DL.ipynb) project is aimed at developing a deep learning model to predict heart failure based on historical data. The dataset used in this project is named "heart_failure.csv," which contains various characteristics related to patients' health. These characteristics include age, anemia, creatinine phosphokinase levels, diabetes, ejection fraction, high blood pressure, platelet count, serum creatinine, serum sodium levels, gender, smoking status, time, and the presence of a heart-related death event (DEATH_EVENT). The purpose of this project is to create a predictive model that can effectively identify patients at risk of heart failure using these features.

# Dataset
The dataset [heart_failure.csv](heart_failure.csv) consists of 299 rows and 13 columns.
The columns in the dataset are as follows:

* 0. age (Age of the patient)
* anaemia (0 for no anemia, 1 for anemia)
* creatinine_phosphokinase (Level of creatinine phosphokinase)
* diabetes (0 for no diabetes, 1 for diabetes)
* ejection_fraction (Ejection fraction of the heart)
* high_blood_pressure (0 for no high blood pressure, 1 for high blood pressure)
* platelets (Platelet count)
* serum_creatinine (Level of serum creatinine)
* serum_sodium (Level of serum sodium)
* sex (0 for female, 1 for male)
* smoking (0 for non-smoker, 1 for smoker)
* time (Follow-up period)
* DEATH_EVENT (0 for no heart-related death event, 1 for heart-related death event)
